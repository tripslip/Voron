 # Above is example 300x300 bed to coorelate with macros and movements below.
 # This example is for a fixed dock, fixed gantry/carraige and moving bed motion system. 
 # RailCore, Ender5, V-Core3, etc...
 # For moving gantry sytem like Voron 2.4, there are some subltle things to change.
 # We have attempetd indicate those in the comments throughout the example code.   
 # Z elevation is shown in movements to ensure adequate Z elevation to avoid crashes. 
 # With the coupling magnets +/- 2mm of the nozzle the probe trigger height is on the
 # ordeer of 12mm, so 15mm is used as a safe height.
 #
 # the printer.cfg-snip.txt has the following config settings 
 # # 
 # #...
 # # add this include statement at the head of the config file
 # [include euclid.cfg]
 # #
 #
 # #
 # # enable enable_force_move to enable FORCE_MOVE and SET_KINEMATIC_POSIITION
 # enable_force_move:true
 # # ...
 #
 # It is assumed that there is a seperate Z-endstop that is used to home Z
 # IF YOU ARE USING PROBE AS ENDSTOP AND PROBE homing_overide must be altered
 #
 # some configurtions may need FORCE_MOVE enabled for kinematic position functionS
 # https://www.klipper3d.org/Config_Reference.html?h=force_move#force_move
 #
 # if you have the hardware defined in the printer.cfg comment out the [probe] section below.
